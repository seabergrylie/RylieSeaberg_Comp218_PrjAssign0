/*Assignment:Norton Dental Office (COMP 218- Data Structures) (Assignment Number): 0
Author(s):Rylie Seaberg
Due Date: Friday, 09/13/2024 11:59:00 PM
Description: This project aims to make a stress-free and easy way for patients at the
 Norton Dental Office to make appointments for the year 2024. Patients can schedule ahead of
 time, and it will be kept track of.
Comments: When inputtiing the month for August (08) and September (09) instead of
 writing 09 for September, you must write 9. While writing the project I was receiving
 errors for invalid octal constant when the 0 was on front of it.
Honor Pledge: I have abided by the Wheaton Honor Code and
all work below was performed by Rylie Seaberg .*/
